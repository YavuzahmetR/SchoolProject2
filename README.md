## Project Overview
This project is the second of our graduation projects. The database scripts can be found in the accompanying text file above. Once the database is created, the code can be executed, making it functional.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a blog site inspired by platforms such as Ekşi Sözlük, Reddit, and Medium. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for users to share and discuss various topics.

To ensure the project runs correctly, please remember to open it in Visual Studio IDE, select the DataAccess layer from the Package Manager, and run the "Update-Database" command.
